                  Research on PLA has shown promising results
                  for college outcomes
              </h2>
              <p>
                  With ongoing public discourse around lack of affordability
                  in postsecondary education and high unemployment rates resulting
                  from the COVID-19 pandemic, innovations that reach adult learners
                  and reduce college costs are timely. One such academic practice,
                  Prior Learning Assessment (PLA), is already in widespread use and
                  could have significant positive impacts.
              </p>
              <p>
                  PLA is when an institution of higher education recognizes
                  learning that occured outside of the traditional college classroom
                  and awards credit for it. This could be learning a student
                  gained from work, serving in the military, taking online
                  classes or any number of nontraditional sources.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Relatively little data about PLA exists, but a few
                  studies have shown promising outcomes for students. This site
                  applies findings from a
                  <a href="https://www.cael.org/news-and-resources/new-research-from-cael-and-wiche-on-prior-learning-assessment-and-adult-student-outcomes"

                      The highest graduation rates are at

                      <br /><br />
                      The lowest are at public two year colleges,
                      where students usually must
                      transfer before they can complete
                      a four year degree.

                      The exciting part about PLA credit is
                      that research suggests it can dramatically
                      raise these rates.
                      <br /><br />
                      A large 2019 study says it raises graduation rates
                      by an average of 17 points for individual students.
                      <br /><br />
                      Applied across all demographics, if everyone
                      could be granted PLA, national graduation rates
                      could be much higher.
                      <br /><br />
                      PLA also reduces the average time and cost
                      of a degree because PLA credits are free or
                      very inexpensive compared to tuition.

                      <br /><br />
                      PLA policy is largely driven by individual colleges though.
                      <br /><br />
                      For-profit and two-year colleges are the most likely
                      and four-year public and private universities are
                      the least likely to allow it.
                      <br /><br />
                      This poses a big problem for transfer students,
                      who may lose the advantage of their PLA credits
                      if the receiving school won’t recognize them.

                      PLA is worth collecting better data about,

                      <br /><br />
                      Especially if statewide articulation agreements
