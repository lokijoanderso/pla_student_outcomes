                  Research on PLA has shown promising results
                  for college outcomes
              </h2>
              <p> With ongoing public discourse around lack of affordability
              in postsecondary education and high unemployment rates resulting
              from the COVID-19 pandemic, innovations that reach adult learners
              and reduce college costs are timely. One such academic practice,
              Prior Learning Assessment (PLA), is already in widespread use and
              could have significant positive impacts. </p>
              <p>PLA is when an institution of higher education recognizes
              learning that occured outside of the traditional college classroom
              and awards credit for it. This could be learning a student
               gained from work, serving in the military, taking online
              classes or any number of nontraditional sources.</p>
              <p> Relatively little data about PLA exists, but a few
              studies have shown promising outcomes for students. This site
              applies findings from a
                  <a href="#footer">2019 study of PLA</a>
              to nationwide student demographics to model what the difference
              between earning PLA credits or not could look like for
              someone's chances of earning a Bachelor's degree, how
              long it might take and how much it could cost.</p>
