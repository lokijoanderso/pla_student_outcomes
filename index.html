                  With ongoing public discourse around lack of affordability
                  in postsecondary education and high unemployment rates resulting
                  from the COVID-19 pandemic, innovations that reach adult learners
                  and reduce college costs are timely. One such academic practice,
                  Prior Learning Assessment (PLA), is already in widespread use and
                  could have significant positive impacts.
              </p>
              <p>
                  PLA is when an institution of higher education recognizes
                  learning that occured outside of the traditional college classroom
                  and awards credit for it. This could be learning a student
                  gained from work, serving in the military, taking online
                  classes or any number of nontraditional sources.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Relatively little data about PLA exists, but a few
                  studies have shown promising outcomes for students. This site
                  applies findings from a

                  long it might take and how much it could cost.

                      Findings say it raises graduation rates by an average
